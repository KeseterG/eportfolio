title="Zorro"
description="Zorro is the robot I programmed and assembled for FIRST Robotics Competition 2021. It is the first robot I have worked on in FRC. I learned Java programming, basic control theory, and some of the programming practices for large projects during this process. This is also the first time I'm able to have on-field experience inside FRC, winning the offseason competition at that time as a secondary programmer."
