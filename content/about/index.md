## Education: Changes & Independence

As an international student, my path to education turned out to be different than what I had originally expected. During middle school, I originally decided to continue my studies in my home country. But, during my learning process, I found my interest in Economics, English Debating, and Engineering - if I go along my original path, I would not be able to pursue any of these in my future 5 - 6 years. The solid foundation given by my middle school also allows me to go international.

And that's why I chose to pursue an International Baccalaureate Diploma at Shanghai Pinghe School for further studies. Finally, I finished my application to college and chose to go to the Georgia Institute of Technology for further studies in Computer Engineering as a foreign student.

What is the most valuable thing brought to me, in my opinion, is my high level of independence. This can be shown both in the field of academics and life. I prefer a way to solve problems on my own, utilizing the internet and other various sources, rather than reaching out for help to other people. This allows me to learn things rapidly and solve complex problems. Living in another city and now in another country is challenging, but my experience allows me to cope and thrive.

For me, such changes are more of a change for me to go out of my comfort zone, meet new people, and make new friends.

## Hobbies

During my free time, I like to play video games, read books, listen to music, and sometimes watch anime. Apart from entertainment, I like things about Robotics and would do some DIY and studies for my projects.
