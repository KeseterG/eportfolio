My participation in the FIRST Robotics Competition started back in year 2021. In March of 2021, I joined our team - IronPulse Robotic - as one of the new members, preparing for the upcoming 2021 off-season in China. In the following two years, I grew to become the team leader and lead programmer of the whole team.
