Robonav is one of the subteams under Robojackets - later the Competitive Robotics Club at Georgia Tech. Under the team, I'm currently a new software member, focusing on learning the team's software stack while leading the integration of software and hardware inside the team, developing a real-time servoing program for the robotics arm on the rover at the same time.
